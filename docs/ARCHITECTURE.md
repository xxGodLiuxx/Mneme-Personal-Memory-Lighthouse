## 1. Project Overview

### 1.1 Vision
*"Every memory is a seed for future creation"*

Building a system that enables the utilization of past thoughts and memories across time. Integrating 11 years of accumulated intellectual assets in Notion databases with Claude Desktop to enhance creative discovery.

### 1.2 Background and Motivation
- **Problem**: Past memories scattered across 11 Notion databases remain dormant
- **Opportunity**: Claude Desktop's emergence enables leveraging past memories in AI conversations
- **Goal**: Enhancing creativity through serendipity (accidental discoveries)

## 2. System Concept

### 2.1 Core Functions

#### A. Serendipity Engine
- Random retrieval of information from past memories
- Weighted selection favoring older memories
- Rediscovery of forgotten valuable information

#### B. Daily Inspiration
- Automatic generation of 5 daily elements:
  - Morning quotes (from quote collections)
  - One year ago today
  - Unrealized ideas from 180+ days ago
  - Learning records from 90+ days ago
  - Past creative exercises

#### C. Knowledge Persistence
- Automatic saving of Claude conversations
- Extraction and accumulation of important insights
- Knowledge inheritance across sessions

### 2.2 Technical Architecture

└─────────────────┘            
```

## 3. Target Notion Databases

### 3.1 Personal Records
1. **Diary** - Daily events and thoughts
2. **General Notes** - Ideas and reflections
3. **Learning Log** - Study records

### 3.2 Creative Content
4. **Idea Collection** - Creative ideas
5. **Synopsis Writing Practice** - Story exercises
6. **Phrases** - Memorable words
7. **Quote Collection** - Inspirational sayings

### 3.3 Work & Tasks
8. **Work Log** - Business records
9. **Communication Log** - Dialogue records
10. **Projects** - Ongoing plans
11. **Tasks** - TODO management

## 4. Implementation Strategy

### 4.1 Phase 1: MVP Implementation
- Basic MCP server construction
- Simple memory CRUD functions
- Claude Desktop integration verification

### 4.2 Phase 2: Hybrid Implementation
- Leverage Claude's existing Notion integration
- Integration with local storage
- Core feature implementation

### 4.3 Phase 3: Extension and Optimization
- Advanced search functionality
- Statistical analysis features
- Multi-device synchronization

## 5. Expected Benefits

### 5.1 Personal Level
- **Memory Activation**: Rediscovery of forgotten valuable information
- **Enhanced Creativity**: New ideas from unexpected combinations
- **Learning Efficiency**: Applying past learnings to present
- **Self-Understanding**: Visualization of thought patterns

### 5.2 Long-term Value
- **Compound Effect of Intellectual Assets**: Value increases over time
- **Externalization of Thought**: Function as brain extension
- **Generational Knowledge Inheritance**: Value as digital legacy

## 6. Design Principles

### 6.1 Simplicity
- Reliable basic functions over complex features
- Simple operations for daily use

### 6.2 Persistence
- Long-term data storage assumption
- Redundancy through cloud synchronization

### 6.3 Privacy
- Personal-use system
- Local-first design

## 7. Success Metrics

### Short-term (3 months)
- Establish daily usage habits
- Accumulate 100+ memories
- Experience serendipity 3+ times per week

### Medium-term (1 year)
- Accumulate 1,000+ memories
- Increase in creative outputs
- Visualization of thought patterns

### Long-term (3 years)
- Systematization of knowledge
- Establishment of new ideation methods
- Model case for personal knowledge management

## 8. Future Prospects

### 8.1 Technical Extensions
- Voice input support
- Image/video memory
- Enhanced AI analysis functions

### 8.2 Application Possibilities
- Family memory sharing
- Researcher customization
- Educational applications

## 9. Conclusion

Mneme has the potential to dramatically improve personal intellectual productivity. Through dialogue with one's past self, it opens new doors to creation. This is not merely a tool, but a project that presents a new way of thinking and memory.
